# What's this about?

It's a small project I am running mainly locally to keep tabs on things I learned, things that I keep googling again and again because I forget.

It's also my way of venturing into the world of React given my experience only in Angular.

# How to run locally

1. run `npm i`
2. run `npm run server`
3. open new terminal, run `npm run start`
